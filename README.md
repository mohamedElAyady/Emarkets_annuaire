To launch a Laravel project follow these steps:
1.Install Composer:
Make sure you have Composer installed on your system. You can download Composer from the official website (https://getcomposer.org/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2.Navigate to the cloned project directory:
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the Laravel project.

3.Install project dependencies:
Run the following command to install the project dependencies specified in the composer.json file:

composer install

4.Create a copy of the .env.example file:
Laravel uses an .env file to store environment-specific configuration. Create a copy of the .env.example file in the same directory and name it .env:

bash

cp .env.example .env

5.Generate an application key:
Run the following command to generate a unique application key for your Laravel project:

vbnet

php artisan key:generate

6.Configure the .env file:
Open the .env file in a text editor and update the necessary configuration options such as database connection details.

7.Run database migrations:
If your Laravel project requires a database, run the database migrations using the following command:

php artisan migrate

8.Start the development server:
Run the following command to start the Laravel development server:

   php artisan serve

Access the project in your web browser:
Once the server starts, you can access your Laravel project by visiting the URL provided by the development server, typically        http://localhost:8000.

Note: Make sure you have the required PHP version and extensions installed as specified in the Laravel project's documentation or composer.json file.
php-version : 8.1
laravel/framework version: 10.8
